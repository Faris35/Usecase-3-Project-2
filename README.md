# Usecase-3-Project-2

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze world university rankings using the dataset from Kaggle. We will address key problem statements related to global and national university rankings and their factors.

### Problem Statements
The project answers the following problem statements question:

1. **Top 10 Global Universities**: Which universities are ranked in the top 10 globally?
2. **Top 10 Employment Outcomes**: Which universities are ranked in the top 10 for employment outcomes?
3. **Saudi Arabian Universities**: What positions do universities in Saudi Arabia hold within the global rankings?
4. **Impact of Various Factors**: Considering various factors such as employment rankings, research rankings, and others, which has the most significant impact on a university's overall ranking?
5. **Correlation Between Rankings**: Is there a correlation between national and global university rankings? Based on this information, can you recommend a country that has a high concentration of top-ranked universities?

## Steps to Complete the Project:

### Step 1: Defining the Problem Statement

We have outlined specific questions that will guide our analysis and research throughout the project.


### Step 2: Collecting Data

This is the most important step because you can't complete your work without data. The project uses specific datasets collected from the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ourfuture/world-university-rankings).

*About Dataset*: The dataset contains universities' world and national rankings and also employability and education rankings and other features we will recognize later.


### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
In this step, we will conduct an exploratory analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.



#### Key Aspects of EDA:
**1. Data Profiling:**
- **Descriptive** Analysis is a statistical method used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset



**Viewing the dataframe**
```python
print(f"Shanghai Ranking DataFrame shape: {shanghai_rank.shape}")
print(f"Times Higher Education DataFrame shape: {times_h.shape}")
print(f"World Rank University DataFrame shape: {word_rank.shape}")
```
```markdown
Shanghai Ranking DataFrame shape: (1000, 6)
Times Higher Education DataFrame shape: (1591, 20)
World Rank University DataFrame shape: (2000, 9)
```
As we see the highest number of rows exists in *World Rank University* dataset and that describes this dataset as more than comprehensive the other datasets.

**Statistics and information** 
```python
print("World Rank University information:-\n")
word_rank.info() # Information about the dataframe
word_rank.describe(include=['object']) # Object columns description
```
```markdown

From this table, we can figure out many things: 
1. World Rank contains a string so we need to deal with it and convert it to int.
2. The USA appears most frequently, indicating a concentration of top-ranked universities.
3. There is no duplication in University Names column so that is good.
4. Educational Rank - Research Rank the most duplication is a dash "-", so that indicates columns contain null values.


- **Check Data Quality Dimensions** are attributes that help assess the quality of data in a dataset. Evaluating these dimensions ensures that the data is fit for its intended purpose.
Evaluating these dimensions ensures that the data is fit for its intended purpose. Here are the key dimensions of data quality:
1. Reliability
2. Timeliness
3. Consistency
4. Relevance
5. Uniqueness
6. Completeness
7. Check Accuracy

The process includes:
- Validating the appropriateness of data types for the dataset.
- Identifying outliers using established validation rule


**2. Data Cleaning:**
- Handling missing values
- Correcting errors.
- Dealing with outliers.

                               
### Step 4: Communicating Results

The analysis is structured around five primary questions: identifying the top 10 global universities, examining employment outcomes, investigating the rankings of Saudi Arabian universities, assessing the impact of various ranking factors, and exploring the correlation between national and global rankings. Through this systematic approach, we aim to provide actionable insights for universities, policymakers, and prospective students.

The findings from this analysis will be presented using both univariate and multivariate techniques, offering a detailed understanding of the data.
